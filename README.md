# Quadstruder-K7-v2---Dual-Drive-Extruder
Updated version of the quadstruder using stainless steel gears instead of brass.  The brass gears in the previous version were showing a fair amount of wear after several months of use.  The stainless gears should last longer, but I haven't tested them for very long.
